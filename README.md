Summary
=================

* Facilitating transactions between the developed and the developing world remains arduous and incredibly expensive

* Through working for a VC and helping set-up an entrepreneurship charity (The African Innovation Prize) in Rwanda I have personally experienced (and paid for) this market inefficiency

* Crytocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a way to overcome these barriers and deliver very low cost, incredibly fast and secure transactions through an internet connection

* A personal area of interest has been in exploring Bitcoin technology to facilitate direct P2P donations between donors and young entrepreneurs - think Kiva for micro-donations but with Bitcoin

* As a first step towards building an MVP of this concept, I developed a simple web platform (see BitDonations) which utilises the Blockchain.info API to dynamically create Bitcoin wallets and facilitate donations between two parties.

* As a second step, I created this mobile app which enables users to sign-up via mobile, create a bitcoin wallet and donate to registered entrepreneurs and their projects. Focus is on the donor user journey with entrepreneurs manually vetted and created.

* The full MVP would focus on developing an operating system/ device appropriate mobile-first application for E.Africa given levels of mobile penetration vs traditional desktop connections in E. Africa and improved usability
